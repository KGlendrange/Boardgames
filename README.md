## Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Nine boards of tic tac toe at once, if you start in the first board but place it in the top right corner, the opponent has to do their turn in the top right board. If you get sent to a board that is either full or has already won, you get to place it anywhere. First to win three local boards next to eachother!
